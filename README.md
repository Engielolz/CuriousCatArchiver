# CuriousCatArchiver
A tool to archive public CuriousCat answer feeds

Use:
  curiouscatarchive.py <username>  
to download an archive of that users answers

Optionally, use:
  imageDL.sh <jsonfile>
to download a local copy of all the curious cat assets, and create a copy of the json file, that uses the local assets.
  
Finally the viewer.html file can be used to load and view either json file, like a regular curious cat feed.
